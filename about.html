      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>I'm a software developer who lives with a lovely wife and an ornery cat on the East Coast of the US. 
      I enjoy building things well and making things work better.</p>

      <h2>about the site</h2>
      <p>This site is generated using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. It contains some HTML and CSS that originated from <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com">Tom Preston-Werner</a> &mdash; thanks, Tom!
      <p>The bulk of the CSS and some of the Javascript for the site are from Twitter's 
      <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> project. It is available under the Apache 2.0 
      license, which is available <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">here</a>.  The rest of the 
      site (including all the articles, html, css, scripts, and anything else that didn't originate from someone else) 
      is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution license</a>.
      <p>The "matt thinks so" banner styling owes its early origins to 
      <a href="https://github.com/nvie/blog">Vincent Driessen's</a> site at <a href="http://nvie.com/">nvie.com</a> 
      &mdash; although his site is far, far prettier than this one.</p>


      <h2>about the content</h2>
      <p>The standard disclaimer holds true:  this is my personal site &mdash; everything here is my opinion (it's "matt thinks so" after all) and does not necessarily reflect the views of my employers. They do not support or endorse this site in any way.</p>

      <h2>about what matt thinks</h2>
      <p>It's probably not true. Matt thought "awry" was pronounced "aww-ree" for a long time. Take the rest of the things he thinks with a grain of salt.</p>

      <h2>about the title</h2>
      <p>I'll be honest &mdash; I was a little hesitant naming it "matt thinks so," in case the tongue-in-cheek-ness didn't convey. 
      There's an implied "...and we all know what THAT's worth" at the end of the blog's title &mdash; not to be confused with "...and therefore, you should believe it" or "...and thus it shall be so!" 
      Blogging might have some degree of built-in hubris to it, but I draw the line at claiming omniscience.</p>
