Matt's Blog
===========

This is the repo that generates my Github site at <matthoffman.github.com> and <matt-thinks-so.com>.
It's parsed into static text by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

It's easy, it works, it's hosted for free by github.  And let's be honest -- free is about what my blog is worth.

The layout here is taken from a few places; it started with Tom Preston-Warner's layout [here](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com) 
and the banner formatting is loosely based on <nvie.com> (although Vincent is a far better designer than I).

The formatting is licensed MIT (use it however you'd like, attribution appreciated but not required) and the text is 
all licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
