For the record, a custom STaX serializer and deserializer for a moderately small object graph will run you about 1000 lines of code. 

Just in case you were curious.

Correction: it's now up to 2000.  It also supports another (rather different) schema that is being mapped to the same domain object, which accounts for much of the increase.

Just thought you might be interested.
