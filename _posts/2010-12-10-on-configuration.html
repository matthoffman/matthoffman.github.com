I've been musing recently on how to scale our configuration system up and out: making it handle single nodes better, and handle multiple nodes...well, at all.
<h2>How it works now</h2>
Right now, our configuration is spread across the following places, roughly in order of precedence:
<ul>
	<li>System properties (-D properties set on the command line)</li>
	<li>a user-editable property file, for overrides to default properties.  This is preserved during system upgrades.</li>
	<li>a "system defaults" property file, user-visible but overwritten during upgrades.</li>
	<li>a database table:  for a while, we were standardizing on properties in the database.  More on this later...</li>
	<li>some property files buried inside jars, which hold some database queries, some default values, and so on.</li>
	<li>log4j.xml</li>
</ul>
We use a MergedPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer, along with a couple other configuration classes available <a title="blast-config on github" href="https://github.com/matthoffman/blast-config">on github</a>) that merges properties from most of the above locations together, ranks them in order of precedence, and then sets them at startup time using Spring's standard placeholder syntax (${property.name}). Database properties are loaded from a table using a special Spring property loader.

So any property can be set in a higher-precedence location and it will override one set in a lower-precedence location.

In practice, new properties tend to get set in the property file. Why? Because database changes require a patch (like a migration in the Rails world) which needs to get migrated to each applicable environment.  Deploying the code to a development or test server then requires both a code update and a database update. In practice, the dependency between the code and particular database patches is a bit of a hassle -- certainly far more so than just adding it to a property file which gets deployed along with the code.  A bad motivation for keeping properties in files?  Perhaps... but it is the reality of it. A system that raises the barrier of entry for doing "the right thing" is a bad system.  Which brings us to...
<h2>Problems with current system</h2>
<ol>
	<li>property files are cumbersome in a distributed environment.  Many of our deployments are single-node, but more and more they're distributed, and distributed deployments should be our default going forward.</li>
	<li>For properties stored in the DB, adding, removing or updating any property requires a DB task, and then a DB refresh, which has the effect of discouraging parameterizing things. You tend to think, "eh, well... I'll just hard-code this for now..."</li>
	<li>Properties are loaded at startup time only – you can't change property values without changing each property file and then restarting each node.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Requirements for a new system:</h2>
I'd like to borrow requirements from <a href="http://jim-mcbeath.blogspot.com/2010/01/reload-that-config-file.html">http://jim-mcbeath.blogspot.com/2010/01/reload-that-config-file.html</a>:
<ol>
<li>Reloading a configuration should be a simple operation for the operator to trigger.
<li>It should not be possible to load an invalid configuration. If the operator tries to do so, the application should continue running with the old configuration.
<li>When reloading a configuration, the application should smoothly switch from the old configuration to the new configuration, ensuring that it is always operating with a consistent configuration. More precisely, an operational sequence that requires a consistent set of configuration parameters for the entire sequence should complete its sequence with the same set of configuration parameters as were active when the sequence started. – For us, this is actually pretty easy.  Our app depends on a task distribution framework, meaning that work is defined as a series of tasks with defined beginnings and endings.  So, we merely need to load the configuration at the beginning of each discrete unit of work.
<li>The application should provide feedback so that the operator knows what the application is doing. Logging, notification or statistics about configuration reloads should be available.

<br /><br />...and I'd add:
<li>We should be able to set configurations for all nodes at once (this could mean using the database, or perhaps a command-line tool that sprays configurations out to the various nodes, plus a web service to tell nodes to reload..or something else entirely).
<li>We should be able to view the current configuration for each node easily.
<li>We should be able to share configuration between our app and other related applications, again, this could be database, or a web service that exposes our properties to other applications.
</ol>
<h2>Current thoughts</h2>
At the code level, I'm thinking of loading properties at the beginning of each task, using a base class or something built into the framework.
Reloading and interrogating the configuration could be via a web service (get_configuration / set_configuration). For requirement 3, the easiest option seems to be to use Configgy as a configuration base.
As far as centralized configuration goes, I'm up in the air. Some options:
<ul>
	<li>Spraying config files (scp'ing configuration files to each server, which would have to be tied to either an automatic poll of files, or a manual "reload_configuration" web service call)</li>
	<li>distributing configuration using a web service (node 2 calls get_all_configuration on node 1, and sets its own configuration accordingly) – but it would need to be saved somewhere in case node 2 restarts when node 1 isn't available. The database is an option, but has development-time issues as noted above.</li>
	<li>saving all configuration in Zookeeper.</li>
</ul>
What i'd really like, though, is a configuration system that kept properties in an immutable data structure that kept track of where properties came from -- so, I could define the locations properties should come from, and then in the application I could say,  "config.getProperty('foo')"  and get the value with the highest precedence (whether that's from an override file, a database table, or whatever).  But I could also say "config.getPropertyDetails('foo') " and get a list that said "property 'foo' is set to 'bar' by local override, is set to 'groo' by the central configuration server, and the 'moo' as a fallback default." Now, why do I want that? Mainly for on-site debugging:  "I set the property in this property file, but it's not working!"

The answerer takes it a couple steps farther, with an interesting SQL analytics query to pull it all in at once. 
        <li><a href="http://commons.apache.org/configuration/">Apache Commons Configuration</a> comes close to the model I described above, with their <a href="http://commons.apache.org/configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/CompositeConfiguration.html">Composite Configuration</a> class.  I looked at Commons Configuration a year or so ago, and thought it was interesting but not quite what I was looking for (and their Hierarchical Configuration concepts can get pretty hairy). But I'm intrigued by the CompositeConfiguration class, so I need to look into it again.  
Of course, the project is all but dead -- last updated 2008 -- but how often does a configuration library really need to change?

I'm open to ideas, as well...  Anyone have best-practices for distributed configuration?
