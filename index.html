  Welcome!  This is a collection of things that I've thought, at some point in time. I find myself writing up comparisons, articles, or 
  short literature reviews as a part of my work. Which probably means I'm hopelessly pedantic. But either way, some of these could possibly benefit
  other people, or at least entertain them with my ignorance ("Can you believe someone THINKS that?!") so they're up here.

  Mixed in is the occasional post about coffee or cooking, from times when I pretend that this is a real blog.

  If you're here, then either Google linked you to one of these posts below, or you're looking for information about me.  
  For the former, hopefully the short descriptions of the posts below is enough to find what you're looking for. For the latter, 
  I'm afraid the "about me" page is woefully sparse, but you'll find some examples of things I've written below.  Enjoy!
