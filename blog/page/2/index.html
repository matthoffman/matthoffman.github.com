  <div class="entry-content"><i>Alternate title:</i> <b>Episode IV: A New Hope</b>

<p>I&#8217;m restarting this blog after a long hiatus &#8211; a couple of years, at least.  It looks like my old posts were purged in the meantime, but that&#8217;s probably for the best<a name="to1" href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  My musings about Hibernate from 2007 are probably not that interesting now<a name="to2" href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Where I&#8217;m coming from:</p>
<p>I work on a team that, in a lot of ways, is on the cusp of Big Data:  we deal with gigabytes, but not terabytes of data, and we don&#8217;t have endless racks of commodity servers.  We have a homegrown task framework that follows a typical master-worker pattern and allows for tasks to be distributed among nodes on different servers.  That works well, and I like the framework in general &#8211; it could use some cleaning up, but it&#8217;s simple, clean and functional.</p>
<p>Data, though, is all stored inside an Oracle database, and we&#8217;re knocking at the edge of it&#8217;s capabilities.  We haven&#8217;t entirely maxed it out yet, but each performance gain has been harder to come by, and we can easily see the time approaching where it will be cheaper to rearchitect how we&#8217;re storing and serving data rather than eke more performance by smarter partitioning, better queries, or a faster SAN.</p>
<p>So over the past several months I&#8217;ve been reading about some of the competitors in the big-data field, and sketching ideas for what I&#8217;d like our architecture to look like going forward.  Things like MapReduce (Hadoop), HBase, Cassandra, or Terracotta, or a number of other ideas &#8211; different types of products, all with the goal of scaling data beyond a single server.  But unlike a lot of folks looking at these options, we have an existing product in production, based on a framework that does 80% of what we need.  So I find myself on a seesaw, going between the newest, coolest thing I&#8217;ve read about, and then the pain of rewriting what we have on a non-existent timeline when what we have works so well &#8211; at today&#8217;s data volumes.</p>
<p>I decided to reinstate this blog to collect what I&#8217;ve learned so far.</p>
<p/>
<p/>
<p><a name="1" href="#to1"><sup>1</sup></a> Does anyone else have the problem of starting blogs like new years&#8217; resolutions and then losing track of them?  I probably have three out there, tied to some forgotten username on goodness knows which host, and they&#8217;re probably saying very insightful things about Hibernate 2.0.</p>
<p><a name="2" href="#to2"><sup>2</sup></a> Turns out, I did recover some old posts from a Typo blog from 2006.  A couple of the most boring just didn&#8217;t make the move over, but most of them are here for morbid curiosity about what seemed interesting at the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, perhaps this isn’t a curiosity to you all.  Perhaps everyone knew this.  But I didn’t, and I didn’t find it in a quick Google search, so I thought I’d put it out here.    </p>

<p>I’m working on a project that uses 2-way (client-auth) SSL; in doing so, I’ve created a test root CA and used it to generate an array of test certs for clients and servers. I’ve done a bit of testing on my local PC, and it’s working well; the server uses client certificates for authentication and authorization of web service requests, and so on. Acegi is our friend. </p>

<p>However, another developer on the project tried accessing the site not long ago and told me it didn’t work.  “I just get ‘Cannot find server’”, he said.  Turns out that he was using Internet Explorer, and I had been using Firefox. I could replicate his results with IE – the browser would give the prompt saying “This site’s certificate is not trusted” or something to that extent, and then when you said “accept the certificate”, it would throw up a “Cannot find server” error.  The same series of steps in Firefox would work without a problem.    </p>

<p>After fiddling a bit, it turns out that adding the test CA to my Trusted Root Certificate Authorities list fixed the problem.  Honestly, I’m not sure why this would be necessary, if Internet Explorer had already asked me whether to accept the site’s certificate, but my best guess is that IE was simply ignoring my answer and refusing to load the site whose certificate was signed with an unknown root CA.   </p>

<p>Again, maybe this is a known bug, but hey, I thought I’d throw it out there.  Adding the test CA to IE’s “trusted root certificates” list fixed the problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been teased that my current project has more external libraries than it does actual lines of code.  Now, I’m not convinced that’s a bad thing – I’ve said before that the hardest thing about leaving Java for some other language would be giving up all of the 3rd-party libraries and projects that do 90% of your work for you. </p>

<p>Today’s is JAMon, a small library with a really simple purpose: keep track of performance statistics. I’ve written static classes or singletons that keep track of min, max and average times for various things on several projects; this just keeps me from having to write it again. Not saving a ton of time, but saving some. And <a href="http://iremia.univ-reunion.fr/intranet/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SpringJamon">here</a> is a simple step-by-step for integrating it into Spring as an interceptor. There are several discussions out there for how to use JAMon with Spring, and whether Spring’s built-in JAMon interceptor (is there anything Spring <em>doesn’t</em> have built in?) should use logging semantics to activate it, but the one above is simply the XML to cut and paste into Appfuse’s Spring config, which is all I really want. I understand what it does, it’s just saving me the five minutes of thinking about it.  Which is what I’m after.  It’s just a beautiful feeling when you want something done, no matter how small, and find that it’s already been done for you.  Like realizing you want another cup of coffee and finding a steaming mug already on your desk.</p>

<p>With that said, I’m going to go make some coffee now… </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been playing with Axis2 for a couple of days.  One of the features that they boast (and added to XFire’s <a href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/Stack+Comparison">SOAP Stack Comparison</a>) is hot-deployable services. </p>

<p>Has anyone ever wanted to hot-deploy a web service? </p>

<p>Really now…</p>

<p>Granted, I’m sure someone could point out the features in some of my projects that no one really wanted. Or, perhaps, someone should point out why in fact this is a killer feature and I’ve just missed it. But it seems particularly weird to me…</p>

<p>Correction: it’s now up to 2000.  It also supports another (rather different) schema that is being mapped to the same domain object, which accounts for much of the increase.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2006-05-01T00:00:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 1<span>st</span>, 2006</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I love JiBX’s flexibility.  I have two different versions of an existing schema that I’m mapping to the same Java object, which is the same Java object I’m then storing in Hibernate.  This is the first time I’ve been able to use the same domain object throughout the application, and I love it.  No more relying on framework-generated objects, and no more translation layers.</p>

<p>Framework-generated objects are bad for my schemas, which have a lot of nested anonymous complex types (hey, I didn’t write them) which frameworks tend to handle badly.  XMLBeans, for instance, creates nested inner types, which gets very ugly.  It may be personal preference, but that seems very messy; it means one very large object. Hibernate, I imagine, would also be unhappy with that setup. </p>

<p>So the alternative is a translation layer – a class that takes in a WebserviceFriendlyDomainObject and spits back a HibernateFriendlyDomainObject. This is a pain to write, but mostly just smells bad – it just shouldn’t be necessary.  I’ve done it as a workaround so far, but it seems like there should be a way around it.</p>

<p>JiBX lets me use the same object from front to back. But that brings me to one of the hates – I have to write a JiBX binding file instead.  It’s funny, because for whatever reason this passes under the “ugly architecture” radar, but it’s actually not much different than writing a translation layer. It’s just writing your translation layer in XML instead of in Java. Which, if anything, simply adds difficulty, because I find myself trying to do complex logic in the binding file that could really benefit from a Turing-complete language. Which is ironic, since I’m writing it to save me from writing the same thing in Java. </p>

<p>Now, it’s still a bit better than a translation layer. The typical translator is converting one object to another object to be turned into XML. The JiBX binding is going straight to XML. It’s certainly faster than the translation step. But from the coder’s point of view, the XMLBeans-generated domain object is one method call away from being XML, so it doesn’t <i>feel</i> substantially different.</p>

<p>My other complaint about JiBX so far is web service support – it’s pretty new, and support in Axis2 (another topic entirely) and XFire is either brand-new or still in CVS.  I’m finding that my data binding layer is informing my choice in web service stacks, which I resent.  I haven’t tried XFire’s JiBX support yet (since Codehaus’s SVN server is down) but they were planning on getting it into 1.1 and it didn’t make it, which isn’t a good sign. </p>

<p>The annoyances of bytecode manipulation are already documented elsewhere; I’ve found that every now and again I have to run an ant task that inserts the JiBX bindings into Eclipse’s class files, and that’s the extent of it. It irks some of people, but doesn’t bother me. </p>

<p>So I’m not sure if JiBX will stay around in this project. That’s in spite of substantial positives – at this point, it could easily fall either way. </p>

<p><i>Update, 2006-05-16:</i></p>

<p>It didn’t stay around. In the end, expressing logic (“if this element… else if this element…”) in XML was too much. I moved over to a hand-rolled STaX serializer and deserializer – see <a href="/2006/05/16/for-the-record.html">“for the record”</a> for a quick peek into the main downside there. </p>

<p>Why I went this route instead of XMLBeans or JAXB merits more discussion.  Briefly, JAXB didn’t meet the performance requirements for this part of the system, and XMLBeans refuses to fully parse the schemas in question. It tries, but something in the deeply nested anonymous complex types gives it fits.  Writing code against those types as they’re generated in XMLBeans is also ugly, but then so is the custom parser. </p>

<p>All in all, I’m coming to terms with the translation layer. But it still feels like it oughtn’t be necessary…  </p>
