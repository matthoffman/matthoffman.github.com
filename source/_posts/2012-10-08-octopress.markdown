I've just switched the blog over to [Octopress](octopress.org).  I've been using vanilla [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for a while to keep up this blog, and I put a bit of effort into configuring it, building up a set of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)-based templates and so on. So, why switch? 

At the end of the day, this is a utilitarian site. I'm not going to impress anyone with my design chops – I enjoy graphic design in theory, and I'd like to think that I'm not the absolute worst at it, but I do little enough HTML these days that it takes a long time to get things done, for end results that are never what I want them to be. And I'd rather put the time into writing actual content[^1]. Meanwhile, my site wasn't displaying terribly well on phones, and Octopress handles mobile devices well out of the box. And it's beautiful to boot[^2]. 

[^1]: Not that, in practice, I've been writing actual content.
[^2]: What a [weird phrase](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9538/why-do-we-say-to-boot).

So, I'm impressed so far. Thanks [Brandon](https://github.com/imathis/octopress)!
