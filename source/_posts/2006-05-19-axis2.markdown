summary: where I rant briefly about Axis2
---

I've been playing with Axis2 for a couple of days.  One of the features that they boast (and added to XFire's [SOAP Stack Comparison](http://xfire.codehaus.org/Stack+Comparison)) is hot-deployable services. 

Has anyone ever wanted to hot-deploy a web service? 

Really now...

Granted, I'm sure someone could point out the features in some of my projects that no one really wanted. Or, perhaps, someone should point out why in fact this is a killer feature and I've just missed it. But it seems particularly weird to me...
